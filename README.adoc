This application is intended to measure time in video clip. Motivation was to create application that can measure / verify air time and synchronization for trampolines.
Thanks to all people who created libraries, tutorials and tools used to create this application.

Usage::
 . Open video file
 . Select desired timestamp cell in table right to the video image.
 . Navigate to time using buttons below video.
 . Continue to next timestamp (Press enter on insert row and use mouse)
